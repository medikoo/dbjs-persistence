v0.0.11  --  2015.12.01
* Introduce `recompute` utilities to recalculate computed data in outer process
* Introduce
  - getDirectAllObjectIds
  - getDirectObjectKeyPath
  - searchDirect
  - recalculateAllSizes
* Replace recalculateDiretSize and recalculateComputedSize with recalculateSize
* Rename getReducedNs to getReducedObject
* Allow early return in search* methods, and make breaking record a resolution value
  (they work similarily to `find` now)
* Unify events names and structure
* Do not emit 'size' events ('reduced' events should be observed instead)
* Emit 'record' events (allows registration for specific ownerId + keyPath)
* Ensure all registered listeners are unbound on close
* Improve handling of bogus storages in TextFile driver
* Reorganise and cleanup internals

v0.0.10  --  2015.11.18
* Significant reorganisation and improvements to internal logic
* Removed various race condition vulnerabilities
* Implement internally write lock functionality
* Rename all driver methods so they start with `__` prefixes
* Make one central method for writes: `__storeRaw`
* Improve methods (both public and private) naming
* `indexCollection` method
* `clear` method
* `trackColletionSize` method
* `trackMultipleSize` method
* Introduce `onWriteDrain` `onWriteLockDrain`  (on demand promises)
* Suppport observation of object creation
* Fix emit of progress events
* Fix keyPaths filter handling
* Bring back support for function filters
* Emit size change events
* Introduce error codes
* Do not memoize indexes, instead crash on duplicate names
* Rename 'custom' namespace to 'reduced'
* Rename 'index' namespace to 'computed'
* Update TextFile storage to use three different (direct, computed, reduced) buckets of data
  instead of one

v0.0.9  --  2015.10.25
* Automatically resolve stamps when handling custom records
* Ensure updates come with new data objects
* No longer rely on index map being held in memory
* Introduce public getIndexedValue method
* Emit old value with events
* Reorganize direct events store handling, and emit events on that as well
* Introduce onDrain promise
* Automatic size tracker for both direct and index records
* Remove `name` support from indexKeyPath (one storage should be after one object type after all)
* Fixes to default driver
	* Fix return value type in _close
	* Ensure database folder is created before any operations

v0.0.8  --  2015.10.22

* Improve operations queue handling
* Improval internal methods names

v0.0.5  --  2015.10.15

* Reconfigure handling of computed results
* Make 'close' operation safe

v0.0.4  --  2015.10.13
* Fix computed properties handling
* Generalize tests

v0.0.3  --  2015.10.12
