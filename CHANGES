v0.0.14  --  2015.12.30
* Unify event name prefixes to `key`, `owner` and `keyid`

* Introduce:
  - deleteDirectObject method
  - deleteDirectManyObjects method
  - storeDirectMany method
  - Generic receiver/emitter utils (to be removed to external repo in future)

  ids
* In getDirectAllObjectIds do not return ids for not initialized objects
* Introduce new name convention for driver specific methods (\_method\_)
* Improve tests organisation
* Unify internal conventions

v0.0.12  --  2015.12.01

  - recalculateAllSizes
* Replace recalculateDiretSize and recalculateComputedSize with recalculateSize
* Rename getReducedNs to getReducedObject
* Allow early return in search* methods, and make breaking record a resolution value
  (they work similarily to `find` now)
* Unify events names and structure
* Do not emit 'size' events ('reduced' events should be observed instead)
* Emit 'record' events (allows registration for specific ownerId + keyPath)
* Ensure all registered listeners are unbound on close

* Update TextFile storage to use three different (direct, computed, reduced) buckets of data
  instead of one

v0.0.9  --  2015.10.25
* Automatically resolve stamps when handling custom records

* Introduce public getIndexedValue method
* Emit old value with events
* Reorganize direct events store handling, and emit events on that as well
* Introduce onDrain promise
